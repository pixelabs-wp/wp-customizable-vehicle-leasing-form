# Mobile Responsiveness Update Summary

## Issue Identified
The leasing form was breaking on mobile devices due to:
- Grid layout not adapting to smaller screens
- Fixed column widths causing elements to become too narrow
- Text and UI elements not properly scaling for mobile devices

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Updates (assets/js/subscription-form.js)
- Changed grid layout to be responsive using TailwindCSS responsive prefixes
- Modified all three render functions to use a single column layout on mobile devices
- Updated from:
  ```js
  container.className = 'alc-grid alc-grid-cols-2 alc-gap-4';
  ```
  To:
  ```js
  container.className = 'alc-grid alc-gap-4 alc-grid-cols-1 sm:alc-grid-cols-2';
  ```
- Added responsive text sizing:
  - Changed from fixed text sizes to responsive ones
  - Example: `alc-text-base sm:alc-text-lg` (smaller on mobile, larger on desktop)

### 2. CSS Updates (src/input.css)
- Replaced hardcoded CSS values with TailwindCSS utility classes
- Added responsive padding and margins to all card elements
- Changed the recommended tag positioning to be more visible on mobile
- Improved button sizing and padding for better touch targets
- Added responsive spacing between sections
- Applied responsive typography throughout the form

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Added a new "Mobile Responsiveness" section to the documentation
- Included information about viewport meta tag requirements
- Provided explanation of the mobile issues and solutions
- Added troubleshooting steps for mobile display problems

## Result
The leasing form now:
- Displays in a single column on mobile devices, making each option card full width
- Uses appropriate text sizes for mobile screens
- Has proper spacing and padding for all elements
- Provides adequate touch targets for mobile users
- Preserves the recommended tag visibility on small screens

## Testing Recommendation
Test the form on various devices and screen sizes to ensure proper display:
- Mobile phones (small screens)
- Tablets (medium screens)
- Desktops (large screens)

Use browser developer tools to simulate different device sizes and verify the responsive behavior works correctly.
